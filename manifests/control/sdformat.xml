    <description brief="an XML format that describes objects and environments for robot simulators">
        SDF is an XML format that describes objects and environments for robot
        simulators, visualization, and control. Originally developed as part of
        the Gazebo robot simulator, SDF was designed with scientific robot
        applications in mind. Over the years, SDF has become a stable, robust,
        and extensible format capable of describing all aspects of robots,
        static and dynamic objects, lighting, terrain, and even physics.
