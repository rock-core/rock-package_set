    <description brief="COLLADA - Digital Asset and FX Exchange Schema (DOM library)">
        COLLADA defines an XML-based schema to make it easy to transport 3D
        assets between applications - enabling diverse 3D authoring and content
        processing tools to be combined into a production pipeline. The
        intermediate language provides comprehensive encoding of visual scenes
        including: geometry, shaders and effects, physics, animation,
        kinematics, and even multiple version representations of the same
        asset.COLLADA FX enables leading 3D authoring tools to work effectively
        together to create shader and effects applications and assets to be
        authored and packaged using OpenGL® Shading Language, Cg, CgFX, and
        DirectX® FX.
